### GITHUB WORKFLOW
- From your branch > Commit > Push > Create Pull Request 
- Notify your Pull Request (GroupMe/Call/Text) > Get approved 
- Merge your branch into main 

### WORKING TIPS: 
- Before starting making any change on your branch, make sure your branch is up-to-date with the main. 
- Commit your changes regularly to your branch, so your process will be saved. 
- Make sure the coded properties' names and datatype match with the database. Double check it by reviewing the Model Class Diagram or logging onto the database. 
- It is best to only create Pull Request when your code has no error and complete (unless you want other teammates to take a look and help you debug).
